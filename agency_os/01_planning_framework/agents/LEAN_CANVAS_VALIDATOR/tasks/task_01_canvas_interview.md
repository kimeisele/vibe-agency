### Opening Statement

```
Welcome! Before we dive into technical planning, I need to validate the business model for your idea.

I'm going to guide you through the "Lean Canvas" - a 9-field framework that helps us identify the riskiest assumptions in your business model BEFORE we invest in building anything.

This will take about 15-20 minutes. Ready to begin?
```

### Interview Sequence

**For each of the 9 fields below:**
1. Ask the question
2. Wait for user response
3. If response is vague, ask a clarifying follow-up
4. Acknowledge the response
5. Move to next field

---

#### Field 1: Problem
**Question:** "Let's start with the problem. What are the top 1-3 problems your target customers currently have? And what alternatives do they use today to solve these problems?"

**Clarifying prompts if needed:**
- "Can you describe a specific painful situation your customers experience?"
- "How are they solving this today (even if it's a bad solution)?"

---

#### Field 2: Customer Segments
**Question:** "Who exactly are the early adopters for this solution? Be as specific as possible - demographics, job titles, behaviors, pain points."

**Clarifying prompts if needed:**
- "If you could only serve ONE narrow customer segment in v1.0, who would it be?"
- "What makes them early adopters vs. mainstream users?"

---

#### Field 3: Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
**Question:** "What is your clear, compelling promise? In one sentence: Why will customers choose your solution over the alternatives you mentioned?"

**Clarifying prompts if needed:**
- "Complete this sentence: 'Unlike [alternative], we [unique benefit].'"
- "What's the single biggest benefit that matters to your early adopters?"

---

#### Field 4: Solution (MVP)
**Question:** "What is the absolute minimum solution (MVP) that would validate your UVP with early adopters? Focus on the bare minimum, not the dream v10.0."

**Clarifying prompts if needed:**
- "If you could only build 3 features, what would they be?"
- "What's the smallest thing you could ship that proves your UVP works?"

---

#### Field 5: Channels
**Question:** "How will you reach your early adopters? What channels (free or paid) will you use to acquire your first 10, 100, 1000 customers?"

**Clarifying prompts if needed:**
- "Where do your early adopters hang out online/offline?"
- "What's your plan for the first 10 users?"

---

#### Field 6: Revenue Streams
**Question:** "How will you make money? Subscription? One-time purchase? Transaction fees? Freemium? Be specific about pricing."

**Clarifying prompts if needed:**
- "What would early adopters be willing to pay for this?"
- "How does this compare to what they pay for alternatives?"

---

#### Field 7: Cost Structure
**Question:** "What are your main fixed and variable costs to deliver the MVP? Consider infrastructure, marketing, salaries, tools, etc."

**Clarifying prompts if needed:**
- "What's the minimum monthly budget to keep this running?"
- "What costs scale with users vs. stay fixed?"

---

#### Field 8: Key Metrics
**Question:** "What is the ONE metric that tells you whether your business model is working? Not vanity metrics - actionable metrics."

**Clarifying prompts if needed:**
- "What metric, if it went up, would prove you're on the right track?"
- "Examples: Customer Acquisition Cost, Lifetime Value, Activation Rate, Retention Rate"

---

#### Field 9: Unfair Advantage
**Question:** "What do you have that can't be easily copied or bought by competitors? This could be insider knowledge, a network, a patent, existing customers, etc."

**Clarifying prompts if needed:**
- "This is the hardest field to fill. It's okay if you don't have one yet."
- "What unique insight or advantage do you have that's hard to replicate?"

---

### Closing Statement

```
Excellent! You've completed the Lean Canvas.

Here's what we captured:

In the next step, I'll analyze which of these assumptions are the riskiest and must be validated by your MVP.
