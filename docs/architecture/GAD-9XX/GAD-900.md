# GAD-900: SEMANTIC ORCHESTRATION - THE PLAYBOOK ENGINE (EPIC)

**Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL (v0.5)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-19  
**Parent:** None (Top-level GAD)

---

## 1. Overview

GAD-9 is the **Semantic Orchestration** pillar - the engine that transforms static workflow definitions into executable task graphs.

**The Problem It Solves:**
- Previous approach: Hardcoded `PlaybookEngine` with fixed workflows
- New approach: Dynamic graph-based execution from YAML definitions
- Result: Workflows become data, enabling domain-specific customization

**Core Components:**
- **GAD-902:** Graph Executor (topology, dependencies, execution)
- **GAD-903:** Workflow Loader (YAML → graph transformation)

---

## 2. Architecture Philosophy

### Separation of Concerns

```
DATA (workflows/*.yaml)
  ↓ parsed by
LOGIC (GAD-903: WorkflowLoader)
  ↓ generates
GRAPH (nodes + edges)
  ↓ executed by
ENGINE (GAD-902: GraphExecutor)
  ↓ delegates to
AGENTS (specialized personas)
```

**Key Principle:** The executor knows nothing about specific workflows. Workflows know nothing about execution logic.

## 3. Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Implementation | Tests |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Graph Executor** | ✅ DONE | `playbook/executor.py` | `tests/test_executor.py` |
| **Workflow Loader** | ✅ DONE | `playbook/loader.py` | `tests/test_workflow_loader.py` |
| **YAML Workflows** | ✅ DONE | `playbook/workflows/*.yaml` | Validated |
| **Schema Validation** | ✅ DONE | `playbook/workflows/_schema.json` | Enforced |

**Test Coverage:** 29 tests across executor + loader (100% passing)

---

## 4. Safety Integration

**GAD-9 depends on GAD-5 (Runtime Engineering):**

- **Circuit Breaker (GAD-509):** Prevents cascading failures during multi-step workflows
- **Quota Manager (GAD-510):** Enforces cost limits across workflow execution
- **Safe Defaults:** Conservative quotas prevent surprise API costs
